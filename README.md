<h1> Duplicate Parser </h1>

Hello everyone,


This repository contains:

lint.py - which checks for duplicate characters in a string. (Y/N confirmation for stripping away duplicates)
test<#>.txt - test files which I tested my parser on.


<h2> Program Usage: </h2>

<h3> From command line: </h3>
<pre><code>python3 lint.py
-OR-
python3 lint.py <name of file you want to parse>
</code></pre>

Example:
test1.txt:
<pre><code>

aaaa
;;;
bbbb
;;;
cccc
;;;;;
</code></pre>
